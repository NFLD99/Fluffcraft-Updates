## Notes from the team:
# 
- **Mrs. Fluff:**
  - Personally, my favorite parts about our modpack: I love how beautiful all the new biomes look as well as all the decor and new flowers! All the new structures to discover plus lots of new mobs—some adorable like the new pet varieties, some not so much like Mutant Monsters, but they’re still fun to find. Tons of new blocks to build with and roofs for when I am feeling lazy and don’t feel like making roofs on my builds.
# 
- **Mr. Fluff:**
  - Personally, I enjoy the tech side of our pack; it’s great to have everything running efficiently and organized. We also have some QOL mods such as Double Doors and Mouse Tweaks that help to enhance the experience further.
